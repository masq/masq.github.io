Hi! I am Spencer Walden, and this is my blog!

### Professionally

I am a cyber security professional. I am passionate about cyber threat
intelligence, network security, python, and malware analysis. I also have a
penchant for teaching, and have been wanting to share my knowledge, which is why
I'm trying to start a blog... again. Hopefully it sticks this time!
