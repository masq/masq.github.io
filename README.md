# Masq

[Spencer Walden's information security blog](https://www.spencerwalden.net)'s
source code. It primarily works by using the contents in the [\_posts](/_posts)
directory and rendering them nicely. It is a static site, so it's pretty
lightweight as well on browsers.

## Built using

Jekyll and Chirpy. They have some licenses that I'd like to try my best to
respect, and so have listed some of them below. Thanks to the developers/authors
of those projects, they make this blog/project possible and easy.

### License

Chirpy (and the projects it uses) are published under the [MIT][mit] License.
