These are the Diamond Model, MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK, and of course, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Threat Kill Chain. While these models are extremely helpful, I take some umbrage with the lattermost model—the kill chain.What is the Kill Chain?In a quick summary, the kill chain is 7 steps—or, 7 links in a chain—that an attacker goes through in an intrusion. The seven steps are as follows: Reconnaisance (Recon) Weaponization Delivery Exploitation Installation Command &amp;amp; Control (C2) Actions on ObjectivesFigure 1: the Cyber Kill Chain graphic from their site.Okay, so this seems great, what’s the problem?Straight up, for defending, this isn’t actually a helpful model. Let’s break it down.Steps 1 and 2Steps 1 and 2 aren’t actually visible from a defender’s perspective in an intrusion. Yes, an attacker does have to do these things (sorta, I’ll get to that in a minute) in order to perform / complete an attack.Steps 2 and 4Steps 2 and 4 require (or at least heavily imply the requirement) that there is an exploit in use during an attack, which is just not true at all. There are plenty of attacks that don’t make use of exploits. They might rely on credential access, or on social engineering. While exploits are scary, they are not the sole Infection Vector type.Step 7Not to mention the fact that step 7 has so much more going on in it than it implies. Most intrusions involve lots of Lateral Movement (LM) in order to achieve those “Actions on Objectives”. Categorizing all of LM, Discovery, Credential Access, etc. under the step 7 umbrella is a disservice to professionals trying to understand an intrusion, and what an actor did or does.SolutionI’d propose the following adaptation to the Cyber Kill Chain: Infection Vector Installation Command &amp;amp; Control (C2) Reconnaisance Lateral Movement Actions on ObjectivesIt really isn’t much of a chain per se, when many of the steps are cyclical within an intrusion. Here’s a diagram that would showcase this better.stateDiagram-v2%% Define our statess1 : Infection Vectors2 : Installations3 : Command &amp;amp; Control (C2)s4 : Reconnaisances5 : Lateral Movements6 : Actions on Objectives%% Define our actual graph/diagram[*] --&amp;gt; s1s1 --&amp;gt; s2note right of s1 Infection Vector could be from external to internal, OR from internal to internal via Lateral Movementend notes2 --&amp;gt; s3s3 --&amp;gt; s4s4 --&amp;gt; s5s5 --&amp;gt; s1s4 --&amp;gt; s6note right of s6 When threat actor has spread to the assets needed to accomplish their objectivesend note" } ]
